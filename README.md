# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation in C++

This C++ program demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph using an adjacency matrix representation.

## Description

The program initializes distances with -1 for unreachable vertices, iteratively updates distances, and then displays the shortest distances from a specified start vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will output the shortest distances from the specified start vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

## Example

Consider the following weighted graph represented by an adjacency matrix:
